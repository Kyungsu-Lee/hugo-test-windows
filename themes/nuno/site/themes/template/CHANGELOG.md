# Changelog

Notable changes to nuno.

Versions are git tags (`v0.2.0`), which is what Hugo Modules and submodule
pinning both read. While the theme is `0.x`, a minor bump may carry a breaking
change and will say so at the top of its section; patch releases never do. The
other contract that matters is `min_version` in `theme.toml` — raising it is
always a minor bump at least.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-22

A post already in a series looks different by default: its aside becomes
Chapters/Contents tabs instead of a plain "On this page" list. Nothing else
moves, posts in no series are untouched, and `params.seriesPanel = false`
restores the old aside everywhere.

### Added

- **A series post now navigates its series from the aside.** The aside becomes
  two tabs — **Chapters**, the whole series with the current part marked, and
  **Contents**, the table of contents that used to sit there alone under "On
  this page". The reader's choice of tab is remembered across posts. New
  optional `seriesGroup` front matter breaks a long series into named sections;
  the heading is emitted whenever the value changes as the list is walked, so
  groups follow reading order rather than overriding it.

  Below 760px, where the aside is hidden, the panel moves into a sheet behind a
  floating **Outline** button; it closes on Escape, on the scrim, and on any
  table-of-contents link.

  Posts in no series are unchanged, on every viewport. So is a reader with no
  JavaScript, who still gets the inline series block under the post header.
  `params.seriesPanel = false` restores the plain "On this page" aside
  everywhere.

### Changed

- **A narrow screen now shows `postsOnHome` posts, not four.** The mobile
  stylesheet cut the home list to four entries with `nth-child`, which
  contradicted the param and — worse — outranked `[hidden]`, so "Show more"
  revealed rows that stayed invisible. The cap is gone from both the grid and
  the ledger; `postsOnHome` and `postsOnHomeMax` now govern every viewport.
  Sites that liked the shorter mobile list can set `postsOnHome = 4`.

### Fixed

- **Tapping search on a phone now raises the keyboard.** The search bundle is
  fetched on demand, so `focus()` ran a network round trip after the tap and
  iOS, which only honours focus inside the gesture that asked for it, opened
  the overlay without a keyboard. The bundle is now warmed on `pointerdown`
  and the overlay opens synchronously on the click that follows.

## 0.2.2 — 2026-09-12

No breaking changes.

### Added

- **`hugo.toml` at the theme root declaring `[module.hugoVersion]`.**
  themes.gohugo.io reads the supported Hugo range from there rather than from
  `min_version` in `theme.toml`; the two are kept in step. It also improves the
  failure on an old Hugo from a cryptic template error to
  `Module "nuno" is not compatible with this Hugo version: Min 0.158.0`.
  `extended` is deliberately unset — it was deprecated in 0.153.0.

- The demo now publishes one build per home style, so each can be linked
  directly: `/ledger/`, `/profile/`, `/grouped/`. Real builds of the same
  content under a subpath, not screenshots, so they cannot drift.
- Dark and light screenshots in the README, referenced by absolute URL so they
  render on themes.gohugo.io as well as on GitHub.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-09-12

No breaking changes, but **one visible behaviour change**: the "Updated …"
byline added in 0.2.0 is now off by default. If you were relying on it, set
`params.showLastmod: true`.

### Fixed

- **The "Updated …" byline no longer fires on commit noise.** It is now behind
  `params.showLastmod`, off by default. Hugo's `.Lastmod` is not a claim that
  the author revised anything: with `enableGitInfo`, the default
  `frontmatter.lastmod` resolves `:git` first, so it is the last commit that
  touched the file. On a site whose posts were bulk-imported, 0.2.0 told readers
  every one of them had been updated on the import date. The README now explains
  how to reorder `frontmatter.lastmod` if you want the line to mean author
  intent. `article:modified_time` and JSON-LD `dateModified` are unchanged.
- **A site-wide `comments: false` now works.** The giscus partial read
  `.Params.comments`, which is page front matter only, so setting it in site
  params did nothing. It now uses `.Param`, which falls back page → site, with a
  page still able to override.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-12

No breaking changes: every addition below is opt-in or additive, and a site that
upgrades without touching its config renders exactly as it did on 0.1.0.

### Added

- **Home page styles — two independent switches.** `params.homeHeader`
  (`masthead` | `profile`) picks the hero and `params.homeStyle` (`grid` |
  `ledger`) picks the post list, the same shape as theme × ground. `profile` is
  a portrait, name, bio and social row in place of the masthead; `ledger` is
  numbered full-width rows, which unlike the grid never leaves a partial row.
  `params.homeGroupByYear` splits a ledger under year headings. Each piece lives
  in `layouts/partials/home/`, so a site can override one without forking
  `index.html`. Unrecognised values warn and fall back. Existing sites need no
  change: with the params unset the home page renders exactly as before.
- `params.profileBio` sets the bio in the profile header; defaults to
  `params.description`.
- **Series navigation.** A post in a `series` lists every part with the current
  one marked. Chronological unless every part sets `seriesOrder`; a series of
  one renders nothing.
- **Related posts** under each post, from Hugo's similarity index, restricted to
  `mainSections`. Needs a `related` config to produce anything — see the README.
  `params.relatedCount` caps it.
- **Self-linking heading anchors**, via a render hook that keeps Hugo's own
  anchor so the table of contents still resolves.
- **`params.postsOnHomeMax`** renders further home posts behind a "Show more"
  button. No second request, and no-JS gets the longer list.
- **JSON-LD**: `BlogPosting` on posts, `WebSite` on the home page, nothing
  elsewhere.
- **`lastmod`** shows an "Updated …" byline and `article:modified_time`,
  compared by calendar day.
- **Multilingual head links** — `hreflang` alternates, `x-default`, `og:locale`,
  and a nav language switcher listing only languages the page exists in.
- **A print stylesheet.** Forced light palette, chrome dropped, external URLs
  spelled out.
- **Footnote styling** for Goldmark's markup, including a `:target` mark.
- **`params.readingProgress`** — an optional scroll bar on posts.
- **Releases.** Versions are git tags; pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag publishes a GitHub
  Release from the matching changelog section. A `go.mod` makes the module path
  explicit, so `hugo mod get github.com/that-daniel/nuno@vX.Y.Z` resolves to the
  tag rather than to a timestamped pseudo-version.
- **Optional giscus comments.** Off unless configured, rendered on posts only,
  disabled per page with `comments: false`, and never printed. The script is not
  requested until the reader scrolls to it, so enabling comments costs nothing
  on a page view that never reaches the bottom — the theme's only third-party
  connection, made as late as possible. The embed follows the light/dark toggle.
  An incomplete config warns at build time rather than shipping the empty box
  giscus renders for one.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, issue and pull request
  templates, and Dependabot for the workflow actions.

### Changed

- **The portrait and the social icon row moved into shared partials**
  (`portrait.html`, `social-row.html`). The About page and the profile home
  header now resolve `params.portrait` through the same lookup order — page
  resource first, then `assets/` — rather than two copies that could drift. The
  About page's rendered markup is unchanged.
- **`min_version` raised from 0.146.0 to 0.158.0.** The theme now uses
  `hugo.Data` and `.Language.Locale`; the APIs they replace are deprecated and
  emit a warning on every build with Hugo 0.156+. Supporting both would have
  meant version-gating three call sites and a config key, which is not worth it
  in a theme this young. CI builds the floor and the latest release.
- `exampleSite` config uses `locale` rather than the deprecated `languageCode`.

### Fixed

- **The table of contents highlight no longer strands on the wrong entry.** It
  asked an `IntersectionObserver` which headings sat inside a band 10% of the
  viewport tall, and only moved the highlight while one did. Any section taller
  than that band scrolled its heading straight through, so the highlight stayed
  on the *previous* section for the whole read — on a long post it never left
  the first entry at all. It now tracks the last heading above the line below
  the nav, computed on a throttled scroll, so there is always a correct answer.
- GitHub now detects the MIT licence. The Nunito attribution moved out of
  `LICENSE` — appended text stops licence scanners matching the file — and into
  `NOTICE`.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-12

First public release, extracted from a theme originally written for one site.

### Added

- Four palettes: light/dark crossed with a warm brown or deep green ground, both
  persisted and applied synchronously so there is no flash.
- One accent colour with an automatically darkened light-mode variant, so accent
  text clears 4.5:1 on the light grounds.
- Typed masthead driven by `data/quotes.yaml`, server-rendered on line one so it
  reads correctly with JavaScript off.
- Lazy ⌘K search over titles, descriptions and tags; the bundle is fetched on
  first use, never on first paint.
- Sticky table of contents, copy buttons on code, build-time image pipeline,
  prefetch on hover.
- Optional certifications, bookshelf and resume sections.
- Full internationalisation: every UI string in `i18n/en.toml`, including the
  ones JavaScript renders.
- Self-contained `exampleSite/`, CI, and Hugo themes gallery screenshots.
